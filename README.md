## **Buildings and Buffs**

1.  ### **Command Center (Corner big building):**

    1.  An occupied Command Center provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also allows members of the occupying Clan to relocate near the Command Center. If the Command Center is taken, you will automatically relocate to your Clan’s Safe Zone.

2.  ### **Arsenal (Center Building) :**

    1.  An occupied Arsenal provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan), plus a bonus amount of Victory Points every 10 minutes (Clan).

3.  ### **Supply point (Material in Map):**

    1.  Members of your Clan can send Formations to Supply Points to gather Victory Points (solo and for our Clan).

4.  ### **Guard Tower (Sentry Tower in Map):**

    1.  An occupied Guard Tower provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also increases damage dealt to the enemy in the Arsenal. This damage buff stacks.

5.  ### **Workshop :**

    1.  An occupied Workshop provides Battlefield Relocation items for members of the occupying Clan (only for use in the battlefield).

6.  ### **Ammo depot (Armory in Map) :**

    1.  An occupied Ammo Depot greatly increases the attack and defence of the members of the occupying Clan.

7.  ### **Gas station :**

    1.  An occupied Gas Station provides Adrenaline to members of the occupying Clan, needed to allow Formations to march over the battlefield.

8.  ### **Hospital :**

    1.  An occupied Hospital greatly increases the healing speed for members of the occupying Clan.

##  **Starting Rules:**

1.  Heal all your troops before joining the battle. Hospitals will have +50% capacity as I have heard

2.  Constantly heal your troops after starting battle, if your hospitals are full they are going to die in main game too

3.  We need either 50 million (50,000,000) points or more points than other clan at the time end for winning the game

## **Building Occupying order:**

1.  Command Center to start getting points

2.  I need all members F4 and F3 in Supply (Material in map) points for gathering victory points at the start of the game, switch or cycle survivors after F1 F2 adrenaline is over (Stamina) and send F1 F2 to gather. If putting 2 formations is not allowed send F4 at supply point

3.  Ammo Depot (Armory) for attack defence buff

4.  Gas Station for adrenaline (Stamina in main game)

5.  Workshop for relocating anywhere in game

6.  Guard Towers for attack buff

7.  Hospitals for increased healing speed

8.  Arsenal (Last and the most important building to occupy)



## **Getting the victory points:**

There are 4 different ways we can get victory points

1.  Occupy Command center (first thing to do)

2.  Gather into supply zone (Material in map)

3.  Kill Walkers around map

4.  Occupy arsenal

· **Note** : Once we occupy the Command center everyone needs to make sure the enemy cannot occupy it. This building will be the sole reason we can win this event
