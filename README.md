## Team Responsibility
- Team 1 wil occupy Arsenal
- Team 2 will occupy Command center at the top
- Team 3 will occupy Command center at the bottom
- Team 4 will occupy Workshop
- All send F4 to get hospital
- After occupying workshop everyone need to relocate and garrison building (Team 1 to arsenal, Team 2 Command center top, Team 3 Command center bottom)
- Team 4 will occupy Gas Station
- Team 1 send F3 to armory
- Team 2 send F3 to occupy guard tower at top
- Team 3 send F3 to occupy guard tower at bottom
- Everyone need to garrison with F1 F2
- Everyone need to gather with F4
- Everyone need to attack other players and buildings of other clan with F3
- Mostly other clan will forget to garrison command center, workshop and hospital. get workshop and gas station first. so their mobility will be limited.
- Than get both command centers and garrison them
- If you are attacking buildings which are garrisoned by other clan then only rally them (strong people will start, weaker join)

## **Buildings and Buffs**

1.  ### **Command Center (Corner big building):**

    1.  An occupied Command Center provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also allows members of the occupying Clan to relocate near the Command Center. If the Command Center is taken, you will automatically relocate to your Clan’s Safe Zone.

2.  ### **Arsenal (Center Building) :**

    1.  An occupied Arsenal provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan), plus a bonus amount of Victory Points every 10 minutes (Clan).

3.  ### **Supply point (Material in Map):**

    1.  Members of your Clan can send Formations to Supply Points to gather Victory Points (solo and for our Clan).

4.  ### **Guard Tower (Sentry Tower in Map):**

    1.  An occupied Guard Tower provides Victory Points (Solo and Clan) for the occupying Clan. It also increases damage dealt to the enemy in the Arsenal. This damage buff stacks.

5.  ### **Workshop :**

    1.  An occupied Workshop provides Battlefield Relocation items for members of the occupying Clan (only for use in the battlefield).

6.  ### **Ammo depot (Armory in Map) :**

    1.  An occupied Ammo Depot greatly increases the attack and defence of the members of the occupying Clan.

7.  ### **Gas station :**

    1.  An occupied Gas Station provides Adrenaline to members of the occupying Clan, needed to allow Formations to march over the battlefield.

8.  ### **Hospital :**

    1.  An occupied Hospital greatly increases the healing speed for members of the occupying Clan.

##  **Starting Rules:**

1.  Heal all your troops before joining the battle. Hospitals will have +50% capacity as I have heard

2.  Constantly heal your troops after starting battle, if your hospitals are full they are going to die in main game too

3.  We need either 50 million (50,000,000) points or more points than other clan at the time end for winning the game

## **Building Occupying order:**

1.  Command Center to start getting points

2.  I need all members F4 and F3 in Supply (Material in map) points for gathering victory points at the start of the game, switch or cycle survivors after F1 F2 adrenaline is over (Stamina) and send F1 F2 to gather. If putting 2 formations is not allowed send F4 at supply point

3.  Ammo Depot (Armory) for attack defence buff

4.  Gas Station for adrenaline (Stamina in main game)

5.  Workshop for relocating anywhere in game

6.  Guard Towers for attack buff

7.  Hospitals for increased healing speed

8.  Arsenal (Last and the most important building to occupy)



## **Getting the victory points:**

There are 4 different ways we can get victory points

1.  Occupy Command center (first thing to do)

2.  Gather into supply zone (Material in map)

3.  Kill Walkers around map

4.  Occupy arsenal

· **Note** : Once we occupy the Command center everyone needs to make sure the enemy cannot occupy it. This building will be the sole reason we can win this event

## Other things to note:
- every building will have some time  before it can be occupied, just like communities (around 2-3 minutes) make sure we garrison the building after attacking.
- heal all your troops before entering the battle, hospitals must be empty.
- after occupying buildings, if you have extra adrenaline, use it to defeat walkers. switch out survivors from F1 to F2 and F1 to F3 so you can defeat the highest level. The more walkers you defeat the more victory points we get. 
- send your F3 and F4 to gather in supply zone after killing walkers with it. save 20-30 percent adrenaline if there is an emergency.
- save your relocation cards you can only get more once you occupy workshop.
- always click the help button, heal troops in 10 minutes batches . for example putting 30 T7 troops for healing takes 10 minutes. I am suggesting this because we have players who can click the help button so those 10 minutes will be instantly finished.
- if you don't have any RSS, get some from inventory. we need atleast something for healing the troops and you are not getting any RSS in battlefield.

## Warnings:
- Talk only important things in main chat. No Hi hello or jokes, if you chat without any kind of importance and other members are not able to read important messages because of you, you will be kicked from whole event.
- Don't leave the event and get into main game. if you do that you can not join the event again, substitute players will take your place.
- all substitutes will be placed according to the absence of selected players in their respective team.
